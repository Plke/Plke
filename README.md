# Bio
You can call me **Planck**.  
I received both my B.E. and M.S. degrees from **Sichuan University**, majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Computer Science**.  
My academic training focuses on machine learning, multimodal representation learning, and large-scale neural networks.

I am particularly interested in building **robust, efficient, and interpretable multimodal systems**, with applications in cross-modal retrieval and vision-language understanding.
